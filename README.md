# turtlebot3-maze-sim
This project is part of the final project for a Robotics class, where the goal was to develop a simulated system that enables the TurtleBot3 (Waffle) robot to autonomously navigate through a maze. Using the Gazebo Classic Simulator and the ROS2 framework, this project integrates key robotics tools such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and Navigation2 to achieve autonomous navigation, mapping, and obstacle avoidance in a simulated maze environment.

Features:
Simulated Maze Environment: A virtual maze is created using Gazebo Classic, featuring various obstacles and walls to test the robot's navigation.
TurtleBot3 Integration: The TurtleBot3 robot model is equipped with LIDAR and other sensors for mapping and obstacle detection.
SLAM Toolbox: Utilizes SLAM for real-time mapping and localization within the maze.
Navigation2 Stack: Implements autonomous path-planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms to navigate the maze.

Technologies Used:
- Gazebo Classic Simulator
- ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)
- SLAM Toolbox
- Navigation2 Stack
- TurtleBot3 (Waffle) Robot Model

Objective:
The project demonstrates the potential of using simulation tools like Gazebo and ROS2 to solve real-world robotic navigation problems. By achieving autonomous maze-solving, the project serves as a foundation for more complex navigation tasks in robotics.
